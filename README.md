# wavelet-network-compression 
This repository implements a learnable fast wavelet transform for use in machine learning models
using pytorch.
It also contains the source code used to create the experimental results which are reportet
in the paper Deep neural network compression via learnable wavelet transforms which is 
available here https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09569.pdf.


###### Experiments:
To repeat the experiments from the paper run any of the run_all files in python.
