# wavelet-network-compression 
Source code for the paper on wavelet based linear layer representations (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09569.pdf). To repeat the experiments from the paper run any of the run_all files in python.

# This is an early release of my most recent research paper. I am still in the process of documenting the code.
